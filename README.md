# Brio
For the 2023 LMI Data Entrepreneurship Challenge, we offer Brio, a web application written in Django to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health factors.

To use the app, you must open a terminal window, clone the github, cd into the "diabetes_lmi" file, and write "python3 manage.py runserver", to start the server. Open "http://localhost:8000/diabetes/predict/" on an internet browser to access the application.
